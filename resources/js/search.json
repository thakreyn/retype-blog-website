Just like we have a version control for Git, Alembic acts as a version control for the Database."]},{"l":"Setup","p":["This section contains information about the steps to setup alembic and also what each of its files mean. If you want to know more about the implementation, you can g","Since Alembic is a python tool, you can easily install by using pip package manner. Just run the following command to install alembic in your environment.","Once this is done, we are ready to use alembic, you can try writing alembic in the terminal to see if it is installed.","Now to start with alembic, we need to initialise our project. So just like git we run the init method to set up alembic for our project.","Once you have initialised alembic, a new folder named alembic will pop up along with a file called alembic.ini. The folder structure for that folder will be as follows:","Here's what these files do: 1. alembic.ini: This is the configuration file for alembic. It defines the database connection and other information which alembic uses to do the migrations. We can also mention things like which tables to include/exclude etc. Following is a sample alembic.ini file:","There might be cases where we want to use multiple .ini files for different cases. Say for example you can have a prod.ini, dev.ini etc. We can then explicitly specify which file to use.","env.py: This is a Python script that sets up the migration environment and provides the necessary configurations for Alembic to manage database migrations.","versions: Versions is a folder which contains all the migration scripts for upgrading or downgrading the datbase. The files inside version are mostly auto-generated and we just need to edit them as per our use-case."]},{"l":"General Flow of things","p":["In alembic, for most use-cases, the following flow is followed:"]},{"l":"Key Commands","p":["Alembic has the following commands available for us in its CLI:","From the above, the ones that are the most important are history, revision and upgrade."]},{"l":"History","p":["History is like your git log. It shows all the changes made in their appropriate order. It shows all the changes/commits or revisions along with their description and the head.","To view the history, we need to run alembic history"]},{"l":"Revision","p":["A revision in alembic is like a git commit. It marks a change in the DB and contains the details about how to get to that state or come back from the state.","Every revision has a description and also a unique hash. This hash can then be used upgrade or downgrade to that particular revision.","To create a new revision we run","This will create a new revision file inside the version.","Here, we can see, every revision has an ID. It also states the revision it upgrades or goes back to. If in case there is a conflict where 2 revisions roll back to the same version, we can change the down_revision values to put them in the right order.","The revision also has other features like","--rev-id is used to give a custom ID to the revisions.","--autogenerate goes through the DB and compares the difference between the DB and the scripts. And it autogenerates the commands to bring the scripts upto the DB. This can be useful when you are doing manual additions to the DB and want to have them added to the scripts too.","Alembic keeps a track of the current version in the DB with the help of a table called alembic. So if we ever need to check the verison of something we can check it on the DB. The local version is dictated by the revision files. Alembic iterates through all the revision files to generate a history."]},{"l":"Upgrade and Downgrade","p":["Whenever we have changes that need to be migrated to the DB, we run the upgrade command. The upgrade command checks the DB and runs all the scripts between the version in the DB and the current local version.","This brings the DB to the latest revision. In case we need to upgrade to a specific revision, we can directly mention the id of that commit. alembic upgrade id","Similar to upgrade, downgrade brings down the DB to a previous revision if we mention that ID OR we can mention it relative to the head."]},{"l":"Conclusion","p":["This was a very brief overview of alembic and what its capabilities are. There are a lot more concepts like branching, merging branches etc. But on the broader scale, this is how alembic is used to migrate and control database schemas. It's a useful tool for simplifying and organising database migrations."]}],[{"l":"Learning React the HARD Way","p":["Documenting my journey of learning react, the hard way.

Thus it can either a simple button OR an entire page. The only rule is that it should have its own logic and appearance.","This was the concept of a component, but in technical terms: \"A component is just a JS function that returns markup / HTML\". This function tells react what to render.","The only caveat is that a components name should always start with a 'capital letter'.","A file can export multiple components if it wants to and there can even be 1 default component that a file exports. But as a good practice, it is better for 1 file to have 1 component. Also a component can have multiple components in it."]},{"l":"JSX","p":["The markup that we return from the component is called JSX. It is a stricter version of HTML that needs all tags to be closed and each component can return only a single JSX tag. In things cases where we want to have multiple tags to be returned, we wrap them in a dummy tag like : .../","To style the components, we can give the components a class and then use those classes to add styles in a separate scss or css file."]},{"l":"Making the JSX Dynamic","p":["In JSX, we can insert variables or logic using {}. Anything inside them is considered and evaluated like normal javascript. These curly braces can be used to display variables, return a list of elements, conditionally render elements etc."]},{"l":"Conditional Rendering","p":["There can be multiple ways to conditionally render:","Using a variable and then having multiple returns:","Or we can use a conditional operator for this and directly render within one return statement","We can use a similar process handle on-click functionalities etc."]}],[{"i":"react---installation","l":"React - Installation","p":["I referred the following document for react installation","The only pre-requisite for react is node.js installed on the system. If we want to deploy it globally, then we don't even need nodeJS as a react website can be directly exported to static HTML, CSS, JS files.","Ideally, the recommended way of using react is using a well defined framework like NextJS, Gatsby, Remix etc.","This is because react in itself doesn't support a lot of things that might be needed for a full fledged web application. React is ideal for single page apps but for more complex, setting up everything manually can be a huge challenge.","For the purpose of learning all the fundamentals and inner workings of React, I will go with the standard react without a framework and then later on progress to something like NextJS."]}],[{"l":"Docker basics"},{"i":"what-is-a-container","l":"What is a container?","p":["It is a containerisation platform.
