# Retype Blog

## Idea
This is my blogging website generated using Retype. For now, I am just setting up the 
base for the website. Haven't yet decided what to post here but just setting up. 

## Deployment
Deploying on Github Actions following the steps mentioned in the documentation.

1. Added a Github Actions Workflow to auto deploy the created website to a 'retype' branch.
2. Setting up github pages to track the 'retype' branch.
