# Main Ideology

The main ideology behind this is to have a small-case which will contain shares from throughout different industries that are key to India's growth. India will grow and these sectors will grow with. My goal is to invest in the largest player in a sector along with the most fundamentally sound / dark horse of the industry. Also the main goal is to invest long term and not cash out of these in terms of a long horizon.

Some things that need to be taken care of for this are:
1. Identification of different industries (and bullishness for each industry)
2. Identification of the players in the industry (and how they might pan out)
3. Deciding weightage of the industries
4. Deciding weightage of companies
5. Parameters to judge companies on
6. Scope for random companies (wild cards)
7. Re-evaluation criteria and timeline (when and how to re-evaluate)
8. Calculation of expected returns and tracking effectiveness.
9. Whether to have 1 basket or multiple.
10. Exit plans (if needed - how to close and when to close)

> We can never say what will happen BUT can always see what is more likely to happen

## 1.  Identification of Sectors

In General Sectors is a large umbrella term. Each sector will have multiple industries within it and then the industries have their companies (players)

In our case, we can rate sectors into 3 categories based on their response to market / economy:
1. CYCLICAL - Very much based on economy / condition of market/country
2. SENSITIVE - Moderate correlation with business cycles
3. DEFENSIVE - Essentials. Not affected very much.

Below, we will rate 11 different sectors into these 3 categories to make sure how they respond to market conditions so as to have a good sense of understanding on when to be bullish for a specific sector and what kind of expectations should we set.

1. Materials - Sell or produce raw materials (trees, mines, chemical, metals, paper and forest)
	1. They are tied to price of commodities ie: directly related to the market / economy. Thus comes under CYCLICAL. And generally stable / fast to bounce when growth grows
2. Industrials - (aerospace, defence, construction, trading companies, services, airlines, transportation, infra, electrical)
	1. Person doesn't buy much from these. Mostly B2B. It is also CYCLICAL (more related to economy). When country does good, these do good. But not all of them as defence or some others might be SENSITIVE. 
	2. Very trusted, safe and 
3. Finance - (bank, investment, insurance, lending, finance services)
	1. Very CYCLICAL. Very dependant on how much money is there in the market.
	2. Most VOLATILE. Worst average returns and deviation and tends to rebound from market most.
4. IT - (software, IT, hardware, semiconductors, comms equipment, payment gateways)
	1. Create growth opportunity for other sectors as well
	2. Not exactly CRITICAL (more like SENSITIVE) as they do their own thing
	3. Very VOLATILE and tough to predict
	4. Long term a large upside.
5. Consumer Discretion - (Wants and not needs - restaurants, shops, cafes)
	1. CYCLICAL - Since they are not neccess
	2. ity, they are generally cut first. Not good in bad times.
6. Consumer Staples - (Essentials - f&B, fmcg, regulars)
	1. Not CYCLICAL - They are DEFENSIVE as they are always needed and fairly dependable and less volatile.
	2. Not a very high ceileing. Decent Growth.
7. Energy - (Oil and Gas, and dependant)
	1. SENSITIVE - Majority revenue is tied to economy and based a lot on political events.
	2. Dependable returns but not very lucrative.
8. Healthcare - (Services, research, drugs, equipments)
	1. DEFENSIVE - Needs doesn't go down and might grow in desperate times. 
	2. Not very fluctuation and easy to shake.
9. Communication (Media, Entertainment, Telecom)
	1. SENSITIVE - Luxury but also needed
10. Utilities - (Carpentry, electronics, appliances)
	1. DEFENSIVE
11. Real Estate - (Housing and housing related)
	1. DEFENSIVE - But might get hit by events / economy. Also might be SENSITIVE.
	2. Not the highest returns, but low volatile.

Additionally these can then also be evaluate based on ownership - Private and Gov.

The next step will be to break down these sectors into industries. For ex: Industrials can be broken into Defence, aerospace, airline, transportation, metals etc. Then from these we can pick industries that we have a slight know-how and can make an informed guess.

### Breaking Down Sectors to Industries

#### 1. Industrials
- Nature: Mostly Cyclical

1. Aerospace and Defence
2. Construction and Engineering
3. Industrial Machinery
4. Electrical Equipment and Components
5. B2B Services and Suppliers
6. Transportation Infra - Rail, Rods, Ships, Docks
7. Airlines

Many more can exist. Can be added to this list anytime. Now the goal is to break down each industry.

#### 2. Materials
* Nature: Cylical
* Description: Raw Materials (Mostly B2B)

1. Metals and Mining - Steel, Iron, Tin, Zinc, Silicon etc.
2. Chemicals - Chemicals for agro, commodity, specialist
3. Construction Materials - Concrete, rocks etc.
