# React - Installation


[I referred the following document for react installation](https://react.dev/learn/installation)

The only pre-requisite for react is node.js installed on the system. If we want to deploy it globally, then we don't even need nodeJS as a react website can be directly exported to static HTML, CSS, JS files.

> Ideally, the recommended way of using react is using a well defined framework like NextJS, Gatsby, Remix etc. 
> 
> This is because react in itself doesn't support a lot of things that might be needed for a full fledged web application. React is ideal for single page apps but for more complex, setting up everything manually can be a huge challenge. 

For the purpose of learning all the fundamentals and inner workings of React, I will go with the standard react without a framework and then later on progress to something like NextJS.
